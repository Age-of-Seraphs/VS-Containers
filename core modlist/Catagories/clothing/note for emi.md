the "Wool and More" mod adds in a lot of wool crafting ingredients
tailors delight adds in needles and a stitching awl for leatherworking


ONLY 6 NEW VARIANTED ITEMS TO START OUT PLEASE.

we need to get the modpack for wipe finished before too much scope creeping into clothing.

pls try and use tailors delight & wool compat as well as vanilla-ish stylization

mods inside of "future updates" are planned to be added later in the life of the server.

"snag from these possibly" feel free to grab clothing models or inspiration from here.

the "fun toys" are not necessarily intended to be added to the game, but are either possible to add at a later date given some C# code work for a new clothing mechanic,

or in the case of servant attire, just to get a laugh out of ya.
